Avatar the Last Airbender
Specifically, water and airbending don’t feel as natural on-screen. In fights between waterbenders, the scenes don’t mesh well together, with the water effects looking unrealistic. By trying to mimic the style seen in the animated show, the seams are showing between the actors and the special effects. Airbending, done primarily by Aang, lacks the magnitude it should have.

Tenet
Tenet undoubtedly boasts an incredibly complex narrative with a unique temporal concept impressively demonstrated through spectacular, loud, jaw-dropping, practical action set pieces.

Upgraded
It’s a sweet movie that accidentally expresses ideas that are complicated and perverse. This isn’t enough to make “Upgraded” transcend its formula, but it does make it slightly better than it had to be.

Les Misérables
Hugh Jackman delivers a muscular, earnest performance that holds together this diverse ensemble cast - which includes predictable but welcome comic relief from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter
